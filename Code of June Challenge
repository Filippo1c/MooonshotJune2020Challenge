### This is code for the Moonshot June 2020 Student Challenge ###
### Creator - Felipe.C ###
    ### To complete the challenge your application will need to have three main features:
    ### 1. It must allow users to add new books to the collection.
    ### 2. The application must allow users to view all the books in their collection.
    ### 3. The application must allow users to find a book within their collection by any of its attributes.
